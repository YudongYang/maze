# Normal MAZE

## Why I coding this?

I like to play some MAZE GAME when I'am young.

Normal MAZE is a game about maze. It's perform better in Mobile.

Your are always in the middle of Screen. And the arrow is where your are facing. 

The gray cell is the wall then you can't through. The green cell is the road that your can walk.

Your can touch the green cell, and you will move to it.

Your TARGET is find the END POINT in the map.

Good luck!
